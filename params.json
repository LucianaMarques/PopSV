{"name":"PopSV","tagline":"","body":"PopSV\r\n=====\r\nPopSV is a structural variation (SV) detection method from high-throughput sequencing. \r\nAbnormal Read-Depth signal is detected by using a population of samples ase reference. Thanks to this population\r\nview the whole genome can be robustly interrogated, including regions of low mappability. Moreover, any divergence from\r\nthe reference samples are detected, even if the signal is incomplete, e.g. tumoral aberrations or SV involving repeats.\r\n\r\nTo install the latest development version: `devtools::install_github(\"jmonlong/PopSV\")`. This requires `devtools` package (more information [here](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)) which can be easily installed with `install.packages(\"devtools\")`. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
