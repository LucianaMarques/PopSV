[Manuscript]()
[Data and scripts]()

[PopSV v1]() was used in this paper.

# How to reproduce the results from the paper ?

The aligned reads are been deposited by the different projects at different locations:

+ The twins study at the European Nucleotide Archive under [ENA PRJEB8308](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB8308).
+ CageKid (renal cell carcinoma) at the European Genome-phenome Archive under [EGAS00001000083](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00001000083).
+ GoNL data can be requested on [their website](http://www.nlgenome.nl/).

All the scripts (mostly R) used to run PopSV on these data are available [there](). Moreover we uploaded temporary files and scripts to make a re-analysis the easiest possible. Hopefully, anyone can download it, unpack and rerun the different modules to re-compute the graphs, tables and numbers described in the paper.

## Structure of the data/script
