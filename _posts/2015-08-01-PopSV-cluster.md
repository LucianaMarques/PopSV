title: Running PopSV on computing clusters
---

PopSV workflow heavily uses [*BatchJobs* package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BatchJobs/index.html) to send computations to a cluster. It needs some configuration but then it saves a lot of time and the pipeline can be run easily. For more information on how to configure it and how the pipelines are using it go to [this page](/cluster).
