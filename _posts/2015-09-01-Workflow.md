First the genome is fragmented and reads mapping in each bin are counted for each sample and GC corrected (1). Next, coverage of the sample is normalized (2) and each bin is tested by computing a Z-score (3), estimating p-values (4) and identifying abnormal regions (5). 

A quick description of the different analysis steps and their corresponding functions can be found in [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflow).
